Challenge
1. When the button is clicked and the answer revealed, 
   change the background color to #68e1fd and text color
   to #1434A4 just in the "question" div.
   ⚠️ You will run into a problem with the background 
   color. See if you can find the solution by googling.
2. When the answer is revealed, make the button disappear.
